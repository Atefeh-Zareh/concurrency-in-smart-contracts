# Utility Java Project for conducting this Survey 

## Overview

This Java project provides utilities for conducting this survey.

## Functionality

- **Comparison**: It compares a list of paper names (`papers.txt`) and a list of references (`references.txt`). These files are stored separately in the resource folder.
- **Outcome**: The project generates another file (`results.rxr`) that indicates which papers are available in the references and which ones are unavailable.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the required input files (`papers.txt` and `references.txt`) are placed in the resource folder.
2. Run the Main.java.
3. Check the generated `results.rxr` file for the comparison outcome.
